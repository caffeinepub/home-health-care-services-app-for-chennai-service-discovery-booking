  "summary": "The diff does not implement backend service seeding (REQ-6). Only project metadata (project_state.json) was updated, which does not satisfy the requirement to pre-populate services on fresh canister install.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Pre-populate the backend with additional service packages so the Services page shows a larger catalog without requiring manual service creation (seed only when services is empty; at least 8 distinct services with English name/description and non-zero pricePerVisit).",
      "reason": "No changes were made to the Motoko backend actor (backend/main.mo) or any backend logic. The only modified file is project_state.json, which cannot implement service seeding or affect getServices results.",
